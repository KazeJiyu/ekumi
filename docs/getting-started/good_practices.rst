Good Practices
==============

Use meaningful names
--------------------

When naming a task it is important to use a clear and easy to understand name.

Since tasks represent computations, it is relevant to use **verbs** to name them. For instance:

- Compute X
- Merge data
- Write to file

When a task is only used to extract data, naming it after the name of the data can make its purpose clearer. For instance, a task used to compute the length of a String may be called Length.

Exceptions are tasks representing mathematical operations. In such cases it may be clearer to use the mathematical expression as name:

- a + b
- y = f(x) + 2b
